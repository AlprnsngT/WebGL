## Introduction

This project showcases the Turkish flag through the use of WebGL technology. It uses vertex and fragment shaders to create the flag's design, including the red background and the white crescent with stars. The program utilizes various concepts, such as shaders, buffers, and vertex arrays, to efficiently render the flag on the canvas.

## Demo
